  <h4>These are advices and tips that can prove useful in your C.S Journey</h4>
  <p>
    1. Pursue knowledge outside of courses<br>
While a fair amount of the knowledge you learn comes from classroom instruction, 
you can also pursue topics in your own time. For example, if you discover you enjoy a topic 
that only came up briefly during a class, you can use your own time to research that topic, 
learning more about computer science as you do so. You can also research computer science, 
information technology, aerospace and defense companies to understand what skills they currently need. 
Part of your research can include searching for internships, part-time and full-time jobs to understand 
the requirements that businesses have for potential careers.<br>
<br>
2. Avoid last-minute studying<br>
This is true for almost any subject, but particularly for computer science. Because a lot of computer science 
classes have practical exams, last-minute studying rarely works. This can help you avoid the stress of trying 
to learn new skills just before exams or other tests and allow you to be relaxed during a test because you're 
not worried about the last-minute subjects you tried to learn. For example, if you have a computer engineering 
class with an exam to fix a computer, studying the ways to do so at the last minute could create stress for you 
during the exam.<br>
<br>
3. Develop theoretical computer skills<br>
A majority of classes for computer science students are practical, but learning about theories can still be helpful. 
One way that you can do this is by studying the foremost computer design companies to see the directions that those 
companies take with their designs. Another way you can learn theoretical knowledge is by watching as new ideas for 
computers arise and which ideas people test and apply to the industry. Finally, you can read about historical theories 
in computer science and how they developed into the theories that the industry uses today in order to understand 
possible futures for computers.<br>
<br>
4. Develop practical computer skills<br>
Most of the practical computer skills you develop can be from the courses you take, but some of them you can 
develop on your own. For example, practicing creating small programs can help you learn a lot about programming 
that classes may not teach you. You can also practice rebuilding computer hardware and even designing and building 
your own computer to meet any needs you have. Other practical skills you can develop include learning mathematics 
that support the direction you want to develop as a computer scientist and learning how computer hardware has 
changed since the invention of modern computers.<br>
<br>
5. Make connections with professors and other students<br>
One challenge computer science students may face is that a lot of their studies are personal and prevent them 
from interacting with others. One way to overcome this challenge is to reach out to professors during their 
office hours, even when you don't need help with assignments and tests. Networking with them can help you keep 
in touch with changes in the field and some of the most recent research they have done. Speaking with your 
professors can also help you create lasting connections and aid in your future job search as you seek your 
first job in the industry.
Another way you can overcome the challenge is by communicating with other students in 
computer science and other fields. Speaking with other computer science students can help you 
learn better study habits, develop new ideas for projects, tests and assignments and create a sense of 
community within the industry. Talking to students in other areas like math can help you develop math 
skills beyond those of your computer science peers while talking to arts and humanities students can help 
you design creative solutions to challenges you may face in classes and help you develop a holistic network 
of future professionals.<br>
<br>
6. Rest and relax<br>
Resting and relaxing when you need to is a major component of studying for any student. 
Taking several courses with different topics and constantly working on assignments can contribute to fatigue 
and lead to higher burnout rates. Making time to relax can help you solve complex problems, design creative 
solutions and ensure that you are taking care of your basic need such as eating and sleeping. Resting when 
you're ill can help you recover more quickly, and understanding when you need to miss classes or work to take 
care of yourself can be a crucial component of your success.<br>
<br>
7. Schedule time to study throughout a term<br>
Because practical elements of computer science can take a long time to learn, it is important to create your 
own study schedule. Schools and universities may offer specific times to study, such as a reading day during 
final exams, but that's a day you can use to rest and relax before final exams. Creating a weekly day where 
you study can help you increase your productivity and remember information that is important for your exams. 
When you create your schedule, try to choose days and times where you can be free of distractions like sporting 
events and club activities.<br>
<br>
8. Develop your math skills<br>
Some parts of computer science require you to know the math behind how they work. Developing your math skills 
can help you be a more versatile computer science student and allow you to understand the material you use. 
You can develop your math skills by taking courses that are often encouraged by programs in computer science. 
You can also develop your maths skills by talking to math students and professors and researching how to do them 
using the internet. Finally, understand you only need to take math courses that support your focus on computer 
science and you can avoid others.<br>
<br>
9. Learn how to write<br>
Computer science students spend a lot of time learning how to write code and use programming languages, 
but being able to write in plain language can help you develop skills for a wider variety of careers. 
Writing in plain language can also help you understand how computer science, people and language are 
all related. Learning how to write has the potential to aid you in expressing your ideas and supporting 
theoretical and practical arguments through logical reasoning and rhetoric. Using writing to express 
yourself outside of academics can also help you rest and relax when you need a break.<br>
<br>
10. Use every available resource<br>
Using every resource available to you can help you be a more versatile student. 
Many schools and universities offer their students several resources such as writing and tutoring 
centers, professors and other students. These resources are often knowledgeable in topics you need 
help with and can help you develop a wider knowledge of computer science. Universities and schools 
might also offer you a variety of student perks and discounts on programs you can use to develop your 
computer science skills. Using these can help you maximize your time during school and minimize personal 
costs you would otherwise have.
Other resources you can use include professionals and companies in the industry and the internet, 
all of which may provide insights into a variety of topics and areas that you may be unfamiliar with. 
Using every resource can also help you develop workplace readiness skills you can put on your resume 
and use for future employment opportunities you earn. Being able to use the internet in a reliable and 
trustworthy way can also help you find solutions to problems quickly, and develop a list of places you can 
go to learn about topics you're unfamiliar with.<br>
<br>
11. Pursue internships<br>
Pursuing internships while you're a student can be an excellent way to learn new skills and create time 
to study. Internships often give you real-world experience that classes cannot offer. They also allow you 
to practice any skills or knowledge you've earned and apply it to challenges and goals within a workplace. 
Internships can help you network with professionals in the field and determine what roles you want to pursue 
in the future. Finally, internships can help you create a robust schedule where you maximize the time you have 
to study, work and rest while taking care of your needs.<br>
<br>
12. Create a personal website<br>
Creating a personal website and keeping it updated can help you use practical skills that 
you've learned as a student. Your website can hold several important artifacts, including your resume, 
projects you've developed or are working on, professionals you've networked with, links to other websites 
and many others. Using your personal website can show that you have the skills employers want and help you 
gain internships and even future full-time roles at computer science companies. Finally, a personal website 
may help others reach out to you with ideas and help you develop different ways to approach challenges in your field.<br>
<br>
13. Design and build an end-of-term project every term<br>
Designing and building a computer science project every term allows you to build on skills 
you've learned in the past and apply new knowledge to your projects. Being able to work on a project 
can help you remember some of the most important and useful knowledge you have. Some of the best times 
to work on these projects are between school terms such as winter and summer breaks or long vacations from school. 
This can also make sure your skills are updated and well-practiced when you return for your next academic term, 
giving you an advantage over students who didn't.
